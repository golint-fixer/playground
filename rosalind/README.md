# Rosalind

This repository contains code samples and [problem](http://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/) solutions for the bioinformatics platform [Rosalind](http://rosalind.info/about/). I had a lot of fun trying to solve these problems and I recommend you to try them out for yourself before looking through the source code.
